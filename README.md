# Portfolio Raihan

Welcome to my portfolio created during my studies at the Bandung Institute of Technology (ITB). This portfolio encompasses various projects and research I have undertaken in two main fields: **Materials Engineering** and **Machine Learning**. Through this portfolio, I aim to showcase my skills, dedication, and understanding in both disciplines. Please enjoy exploring my work.
